* Shortify
This app is used to apply /Rolling Prediction Averaging/ on Microsoft Teams meeting so as to remove the lobby-parts and silence them.
This can also be seen as a meeting summarization technique as it removes the silent and non-presentation part.

** Requirements
A working Python installation is needed , other packages needed are
- Tensorflow for using the model
- MoviePy for splitting and joining clips
- Unsilence for silencing the video clip
- Tabulate for prettify
- Colorama for color output
- Prompt Toolkit for prompts

You also need the model stored in a folder named model , in the standard Tensorflow format(not H5!).
You can obtain it by training the model defined in the ~ipynb~ file. Run it on a GPU-enabled machine for faster training.

For sucessfull installation of MoviePy and Unsilence requires working installation of /ffmpeg/.
** Usage
Just clone the repository and run the python file shortify.py
#+begin_src sh
python shortify.py
#+end_src
